# nosql-challenge

This challenge was pretty interesting. I worked with mongo a lot at my last job, but mostly just select queries, so this was a lot of fun to expand my knowledge.

I learned that when trying to update the type of the field, you need to use [] even if you are only providing a list of one. The error that I got was super annoying and it led me to dropping and resetting my db twice before figuring out the problem.

The other hard point for me with this project was learning when I can use .sort() and when I can't. That was frustrating, but once I had my data showing, it was easy to understand why I can't use .sort() on anything.

As always the sample code and the data comes from UCB's class.
